I am a driven and well-rounded senior at Texas State University with a strong knack for optimization and a passion for tackling challenging problems across diverse disciplines. My strongest languages are C, C++, Java, and Python, and I am interested in any challenging, high-impact opportunities.

## 🔧 Current interests and past experience

- **Multi-modal Transformers**: Training multi-modal transformers (PyTorch and TensorFlow Keras) and distilling them to run on Android phones and wearables (Java, Kotlin)
- **RTOS Development**: Writing RTOS firmware/software
- **ML Model Deployment**: Fine-tuned various models and hosted them using full stack and machine learning frameworks (Docker, Python, AWS, Huggingface, FastAPI, PyTorch)
- **Full Stack Development**: Various full stack React, JavaScript, and Java projects
- **Edge Computing**: Quantizing machine learning models to run on edge/embedded devices using C++
- **Data Engineering**: Database and web scraping/querying

## 🚀 Currently Working On

- Multi-modal transformers on edge devices for ML research group
- Getting better at programming
- Learning C++ 17/20
- Learning distributed systems and building more impactful projects
- CUDA and paralleization
- Real time high performance systems
- Rust ( haven't started yet :/ )
